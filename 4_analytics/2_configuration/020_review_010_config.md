## Document Source Management

Needs to be mapped to each source to avoid showing any Unknown values: [Document source](https://success.medius.com/documentation/administration_guide/administration_pages/document_source_management/#gatsby-focus-wrapper). 

## Currency Rate 

Needs to be setup correctly to avoid dashboards showing incorrect values: [Currency rate](https://success.medius.com/documentation/administration_guide/administration_pages/currency_rate/). 

## Category (Procurement customers only) 

To give an optimal user experience to the Procurement Dashboard, we recommend to use a UNSPSC category tree: [Category](https://success.medius.com/documentation/administration_guide/administration_pages/category/).

It is also strongly recommended that the ERP integration with Payment Date and Payment status is setup to get the most out of Analytics.
