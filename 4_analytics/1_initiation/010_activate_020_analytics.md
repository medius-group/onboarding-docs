### Start using Analytics

Once it has been successfully activated, you are just one step away from starting to use it.  

Your user admin should apply the role “Analytics Application Access Role” to the users that should have access to Analytics. The access is restricted to a limited number of users according to your Agreement with Medius.
 
See the [product sheet](https://www.medius.com/resources/product-brochures/analytics-product-sheet/) for information about the module and visit our [Success Portal](https://success.medius.com/documentation/analytics/) to get more information about how to get started.
