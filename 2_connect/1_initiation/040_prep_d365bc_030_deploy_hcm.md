Please follow the installation guide below to install the Microsoft Hybrid Connection Manager. The purpose of this component is to create a secure channel so the calls from the central integration infrastructure can be made in the local network without the need to open up the ERP instance for public access. It's not mandatory to use the HCM, there may be other solutions to create secure access to the local D365BC environment.
