For integration with Microsoft Dynamics NAV, Medius has a package of objects to be installed in NAV. The objects are stand-alone objects and will not override any existing objects in ERP. The objects consists of tables, forms/pages, codeunits and menu suite. These objects will be used for setting up the integration, fetching masterdata from NAV and for posting invoices to NAV.

For NAV 2009 to 2015 the objects are packaged in a txt-file and for NAV 2016 and later they are delivered as extensions in a NAVX-file.
The installation in NAV is done by customer (or customer's erp-partner). This makes it possible for the customer to synchronize this with other upgrades/installation of their ERP. The customer is responsible for the maintenance of their ERP system. 

More information on how to deploy the objects in Microsoft Dynamics NAV can be found here:
