Before getting into details, have a look at the test tools that are available. This is often useful tools to understand how the API's would like to receive the information.

1. [Test portal](https://cloud.mediusflow.com/$TenantNameQA/api/documentation/)
2. [Postman collections](https://success.mediusflow.com/documentation/integration-documentation/technical/rest/specification/#postman-collections)

## Test portal
The [Test portal](https://cloud.mediusflow.com/$TenantNameQA/api/documentation/) is a useful tool to both test the API's and also see the swagger specification. The swagger specification holds all necessary information about the API's, also description of available fields and field lengths. 

A client in Medius AP Automation needs to be activated to be able to work with the test tool. You can read about it [here](https://success.mediusflow.com/documentation/integration-documentation/technical/rest/specification/#activate-the-full-api-testing-capabilities) and activate the client [here](https://cloud.mediusflow.com/$TenantNameQA/#/Administration/Medius.Core.Entities.Api.ClientApplication).

## Postman Collections
Postman is an API request tool that simplifies testing of APIs. We provided a set of test collections you can use to test the different scenarios. You can find them [here](https://success.mediusflow.com/documentation/integration-documentation/technical/rest/specification/#postman-collections)
