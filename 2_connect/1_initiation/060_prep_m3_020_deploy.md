The interface is described here:

[M3 Product Definition](https://success.mediusflow.com/documentation/cts-documentation/On-Premise-Connectors/M3/M3_product/)

The most common scenario is that Medius partner Columbus is doing the installation. To order an installation in your Medius project your Medius consultant will assign a task to Columbus. 

[//]: # (TODO: If this documentation should be written with the customer as target person. Perhaps this link should not be shown but for the medius consultant this information on how to order deployment by the interface is important information.https://medius.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MFP/pages/85499643/iStone+escalation+routine)


How Columbus do the installation is briefly described here:
