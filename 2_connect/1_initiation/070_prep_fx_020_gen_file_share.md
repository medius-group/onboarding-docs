The file share that is being used to exchange files to/from Medius as well as the communication scheduling between the file share and Medius needs to be generated by your Medius contact. This is done by:

1. Find "Cloud Integration Gateway" in the list of client applications [here](https://cloud.mediusflow.com/$TenantNameQA/#/Administration/Medius.Core.Entities.Api.ClientApplication/).
and enable it by switching the Enabled toggle to YES.
2. Execute the Jenkins job found here: [Generate FX CIG instance and file share](http://cloudjenkins.medius.local:8080/job/New%20-%20FX%20Integration%20File%20Share/) with tenant name as input parameter.
