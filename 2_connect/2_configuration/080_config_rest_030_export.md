## Posting to ERP
When it comes to postings and where to start it depends on the scope. I.e. do you need a preliminary posting or only a final posting. Is it only Expense invoice or also Purchase order invoices, Contract based invoices, check requests etc. 

General information on set-up of the [Supplier invoice flow](https://success.mediusflow.com/documentation/integration-documentation/technical/rest/scenarios/#running-the-supplier-invoice-posting-flow)

Start as simple as possible. You need invoices from Medius AP Automation to have something to work with. You can find the message que in GUI here: [Message management](https://cloud.mediusflow.com/$TenantNameQA/MessageManagement/Index).
