## Posting to ERP

When it comes to postings and where to start it depends on the scope. 

* Do you need a preliminary posting or only a final posting? 
* Is it only non-PO invoices or PO invoices, Contract based invoices, check requests etc.?

Start as simple as possible. You need invoices from Medius AP Automation to have something to work with. You can find the message que in GUI here: [Message management](https://cloud.mediusflow.com/$TenantNameQA/MessageManagement/Index).
