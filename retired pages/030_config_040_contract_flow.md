Before getting started it is recommended to study the introduction to [Recurring invoice workflow](https://success.mediusflow.com/documentation/administration_guide/applications/contract/workflow/) and go through all workflow steps presented in subpages. 
Based on findings and preferred workflow Medius should be configured in the areas presented below.

## Recurring invoice application responsible settings
In Medius you assign users or roles responsible for different steps of the process. 
These settings determine what users or group of users that are responsible to perform certain tasks.

Best practice is to use roles instead of individual users to be able to share workload as well as easier administration if 
there are changes to responsibilities/teams. 

Verify standard setup or apply desired adjustments here: [Supplier contract responsible settings](https://cloud.mediusflow.com/$TenantNameQA/#/Administration/Medius.Core.Entities.Company).

1. Choose what Company to apply settings to. It is recommended to apply settings at virtual level for minimal administration.
2. Go to tab "Contract".
3. Go to sub tab "Responsible".
