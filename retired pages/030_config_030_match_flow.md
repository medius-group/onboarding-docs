This section covers the match invoice application settings that needs to be configured based upon your organization's structure and processes. 
We recommend this is done in cooperation with your implementation partner that can guide you through this process.

Before getting started we recommended you to study the introduction to [Match invoice workflow](https://success.mediusflow.com/documentation/administration_guide/applications/invoice/workflow/) and go through all workflow steps presented in subpages. 
Based on the findings and preferred workflow Medius should be configured in the areas presented below in the sub-pages.

## Match application responsible settings
The best practice approach is to assign roles instead of individual users. 
This will enable shared workload as well as easier administration if there are changes within your organization.
