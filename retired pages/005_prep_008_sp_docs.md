For each project, a set of documents should be prepared. 

Documents should be copied from the template library to the SharePoint Project Site, and updated related to scope and methodology.

Mandatory documents for all projects:
* 107-RolesResponsibilities or 107-RolesResponsibilitiesGovernance - which document to upload depends on project needs.
* 103-ConfigurationQuestionnaire - the document should then be configured for the project scope

Optional documents, depending on scope and methodology:
* No documents yet identified - to be updated
