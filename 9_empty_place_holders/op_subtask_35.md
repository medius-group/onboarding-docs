A critical step in the execution of a successful implementation of Medius is testing against your current business processes. Planning for an efficient testing period will lead to a shorter project duration as well as reducing risk after go-live.

It is therefore recommended that the UAT and development of test scripts are considered early in the project, rather than being something that is only taken into consideration at the start of the UAT or even later.

As part of the project, Medius will issue to you a set of standard test scripts that give scenarios which will enable you to become familiar with the system and test the standard worksflow. But it is critical that any specific business related scenarios identified in the workshop that might be outside of this standard Medius workflow are documented and added to these standard test cases.
