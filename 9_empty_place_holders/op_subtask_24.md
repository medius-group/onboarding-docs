Login into Medius via the URL that has been presented during or prior to training. This will take the form of cloud.medius.com/(company)QA where (company) will be your company specific identifier and QA represents that it is the test environment. The production tenant will take the same structure, though minus the QA signature.

Click on the link to your QA environment. Two options are available for logging in: one via Office 365 and one via a local login. In this instance follow the instructions to log in via O365, as per other applications.

You should then automatically arrive into the home screen of Medius. Please report any error messages to the project team.
