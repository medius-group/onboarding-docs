The Configuration questionnaire is a excel based document that is made up of several tabs, related to specific information that is needed during the initiation phase of the project. This information will allow your Medius project team to configure your QA (test) environment and start with deployment of integrations.

**Overview:** This specifies the scope of the project. Please confirm that the scope highlighted as “Yes” is correct as this will impact the remaining tabs.

**APA Proc. & Data:** This is information related to how your organisation is structured and handles invoice workflows.

**Azure AD:** This tab relates to user import and authentication. Additional information on the user import alternatives can be found in the following section: xxx.

**D365FO Related Processes & Data:** Data related to masterdata and integration configuration towards D365FO.

**D365FO Technical details:** Technical information required to start the D365 F&O integration activities. 

The final two tabs relating to D365 are considered the most critical in order to meet initial project timelines and should be completed as a priority.
