### The Configuration Questionnaire

Medius issues a configuration questionnaire to collect as much of the configuration information upfront as possible. Each section contained in this document provides background to configurations that Medius is trying to encapsulate alongside specific questions which relate to config options. 

Please read through all background information which supplements the video content on this portal so that when responding to the question it is understood what exactly Medius are asking for and what each configuration would achieve. 

Medius intends to review all responses provided and if any contentious questions can not be completed or questions provided look out of the ordinary or conflicting, Medius will engage directly in a dedicated review meeting. 

Medius accepts that some configuration options indicated in this document may require a review during testing and that some of the additional setups can only be completed once some sample data is provided. 

Medius will provide additional templates if required after the initial configuration review.
