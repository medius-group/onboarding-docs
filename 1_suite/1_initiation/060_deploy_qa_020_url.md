## Important Instructions for Naming Your Tenant

**What is a Tenant?**  
A Tenant is your dedicated space within our cloud-based system, where your company's data and applications are hosted. It is uniquely identified by the name you choose, which will be part of your system's URLs.

**Please read carefully before selecting a name for your Tenant:**

1. **Naming for URLs**:  
   The name you choose will be part of the URLs for both Test and Production Tenants. Note that Production will be activated at a later stage.

2. **Automatic QA Addition**:  
   For the Test Tenant, "QA" will automatically be added to the name. Therefore, do not include terms like "test," "QA," or "sandbox" in the name you select.

3. **Keep It Simple**:  
   We recommend using a straightforward name, such as your company website's name.

4. **Subsidiary Considerations**:  
   If you are part of a larger organization or group, choose a name that reflects your subsidiary status. This will help other subsidiaries or parent companies name their Tenant appropriately.

5. **Permanent Choice**:  
   **Once set, the Tenant name cannot be changed.**

6. **Region Selection**:  
   Confirm or change the pre-selected region. This determines the data center where your Tenant will be created.
