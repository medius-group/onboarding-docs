### Start using Analytics

First you have to request activation. When you do this, two things occur in the background:

1. Analytics is activated at the suite level, a process that happens almost instantly, enabling the application of Analytics roles.
2. The service is technically deployed and data is uploaded, a process typically completed within 48 hours.

Notification emails will be sent to contacts defined via Onboarding Portal settings once a task is completed and status will also be reflected on the task tile and on the home page.

***Note:** If you received the email "Your new products are ready for activation", then you are set up as the primary customer contact, and you will receive a notification email when Analytics is completely activated.*

Secondly your user admin should apply the role “Analytics Application Access Role” to the users that should have access to Analytics. This can be done when activation has been requested, even if has not completed. The access is restricted to a limited number of users according to your Agreement with Medius.
