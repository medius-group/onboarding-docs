**Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations**

Medius offers a fully-managed integration between Medius AP Automation and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations (“Dynamics 365 Finance”, “D365FO”).

* New features and functions provided in Medius are available automatically in monthly releases without any dependency in your ERP infrastructure.
* Low impact on your ERP upgrade process.
* The solution adds value to Dynamics 365 for Finance & Operations
