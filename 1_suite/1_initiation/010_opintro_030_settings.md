Onboarding portal Settings can be accessed from the cogwheel icon found to the right in the top application bar.   

There are four features available.

### Order summary

Displays suite edition, applications and add-ons (sub-modules) in scope (subscription exists).

### Contact list 

When activation tasks are completed, emails are sent to contacts with the "Receive notification" flag set to Yes. Primary contacts also receive credentials where applicable. 

There could only be one primary contact for customer and implementation partner respectively.  

### Link Library

Add links to any site.

### Customer Logo

Upload and display a logotype on the Onboarding Portal home page.

### Welcome emails

Send the “Welcome to Medius” email, with initial instructions and a link to the onboarding portal, to any combination of contacts, regardless of whether it has been sent before or not.

You can also view when this email has been sent and to whom. By default, a new customer will receive it when the OP is created.

### Deployment Queue

Queue any combination of activation tasks. Queue means that they will be executed as soon as their parent task is completed. In most cases the parent task is tenant creation, but there are are a few exceptions. 

Please note:
* That tenant creation must be in progress or completed to queue tasks.
* That once executed, most task will complete in no time at all, but a few tasks (like requesting Capture company emails) will take days before completed.
