## Onboarding Portal Settings

Access the Onboarding Portal settings by clicking the cogwheel icon located on the right side of the top application bar.

There are several features available:

### Order Summary

Displays applications and add-ons (sub-modules) included in your subscription.

### Contact List

When activation tasks are completed, emails are sent to contacts with the "Receive notification" flag set to **Yes**. Primary contacts also receive credentials where applicable.

There can be only one primary contact for the customer and one for the implementation partner, respectively.

### Link Library

Add links to any site for easy access.

### Customer Logo

Upload and display a logo on the Onboarding Portal home page.

### Welcome Emails

Send the “Welcome to Medius” email, which includes initial instructions and a link to the onboarding portal, to any combination of contacts, regardless of whether it has been sent before.

You can also view when this email has been sent and to whom. By default, a new customer will receive it when the Onboarding Portal is created.
