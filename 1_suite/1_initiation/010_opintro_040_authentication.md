# Test

Once the test tenant has been created: 
* Users will be required to authenticate to access the Onboarding Portal 
* The Onboarding Portal shares authentication mechanism with the Medius suite
* The Admin role is required and any user having that role will be able to log in 
* If you have logged in to APA, then you have logged in to the Onboarding Portal as well and the other way around
* An onboarding admin user account is set up by default upon test tenant creation and credentials for the account are sent to primary contacts (as defined in Onboarding Portal settings)

# Production

When the production tenant exists:
* You will need to authenticate against production instead of test 
* A task for this purpose is available on platform level
* When executing it you will be logged out and prompted for new log in 
* After successful log in, any remaining deployment activities for production will be enabled
