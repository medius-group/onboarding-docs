Please note:
* Once the QA tenant has been created, users will be required to authenticate to access the Onboarding Portal.
* Initial credentials are sent to primary contacts as defined in Settings.
* The Onboarding Portal shares authentication mechanism with the Medius suite.
* When the production tenant have been created, then you will need to authenticate against prod instead of QA in order to enable any remaining deployment tasks for prod.
