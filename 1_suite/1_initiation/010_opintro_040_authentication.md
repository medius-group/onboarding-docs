# Accessing the Onboarding Portal

Receiving the OP URL:
*	The OP URL is emailed to the customerâ€™s primary contact.

Access Before Test (QA) Tenant Creation:
*	Access the OP using the provided URL without any additional authentication.

Access After Test (QA) Tenant Creation:
*	Authentication is required to ensure that only authorized personnel can make deployments.
*	Without logging in, you can view product status and complete Getting Started tasks for new customers.
*	To activate products, you must log in. Use the login button on the landing page if you are not already logged into the suite.
*	Once logged in, product activations are enabled.

Shared Authentication:
*	The OP uses the same authentication system as the Medius suite, ensuring a seamless login experience. If you are logged into the suite, you are also logged into the OP.

Admin Role Required:
*	Only users with the Admin role are permitted to log in to the OP.

Default Admin Account:
*	A default admin account is created when the QA tenant is set up.
*	Credentials for this account are sent to the primary contact as specified in the OP settings.
*	This account can be used to access the suite, including the OP.
> Note: *Creating user profiles within the Medius tenant is typically a dedicated project activity and may require coordination with your implementation partner. Please consult with your implementation partner before creating any accounts in the Medius tenant.*
