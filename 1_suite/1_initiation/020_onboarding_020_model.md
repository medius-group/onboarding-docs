**Below is a high level overview of the onboarding model that will be adopted for your implementation of Medius APA.**
<Figure 1>

_Phase 1: Initiation_
The focus of the initiation phase will be to hold a kick off meeting between project teams and then gather the necessary data required to start the deployment of integrations towards Medius. The Medius project team will then do an initial configuration of the QA (test) environment and integration towards your ERP, based on best practice and initial findings from the onboarding questionnaire.

It is also an opportunity to set the governance structure of the project for the coming months.

_Phase 2: Onboarding and Design_
The major milestones and activities within this phase will be the completion of the functional workshop, which will have the following primary objectives:

1. For you as an organisation to understand the invoice flows and main functionality of Medius AP Automation.
2. For Medius to understand your desired processes in order to map these into AP Automation.
3. Output from the workshop is compiled in a “Functional specification document”.

Following the workshop there will be a requirement for the Medius project team to configure the APA QA environment ahead of UAT. 

_Phase 3: Training and UAT_
At the start of the training and UAT phase, Medius will hold a series of train-the-trainer sessions, focusing on giving your superusers the necessary knowledge to start testing Medius APA.

From here the responsibility will be on you to test the system based on your organizational practices and accounting requirements.

Once UAT is compete and you are happy with the system, you will sign off the solution and we can move into go-live activities.

_Phase 4: Go Live and Hypercare_
Once approved, we will take a copy of the QA system and move it to production tenant, removing any test documents such as invoices and purchase orders. This means that any configuration made in QA does not need to be copied over manually. Production integrations are then set-up, and the system is deemed ready to go live.

From there we will then support you through a hypercare period, which will span 2-3 weeks depending on requirements. Here you will have increased focus from the Medius project team so that we can resolve any issues that arrive as quickly as possible.
