## Conditions

Your QA environment/tenant will exist in Microsoft Azure. The actual deployment is triggered in the next sub-task.

Before doing so you should consider how it should be named. The name you select will be a part of the URL (web address) and it will not be changed once deployed.

Preferably it should be your company name, but without any spaces included.

In addition you should select region. This will decide in which data center your tentant will be located. It should likely be the one closest to your headquarters and it is pre-selected (but can be changed) based on information from your subscription.

## Deployment

In the next sub-task you enter name and select region. Thereafter you start the deployment. It will take up to one hour to complete and status will be updated once it is ready.

If you have questions or need support, please contact your implementation partner before starting the deployment!
