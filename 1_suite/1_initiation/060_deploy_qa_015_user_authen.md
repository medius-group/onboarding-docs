Please note that:
* Once the test tenant has been created, users will be required to authenticate to access the Onboarding Portal. 
* Initial credentials are sent to primary contacts (as defined in Onboarding Portal settings).
* The Onboarding Portal shares authentication mechanism with the Medius suite.
* When the production tenant exists, you will need to authenticate against production instead of test in order to enable any remaining deployment activities for production.
