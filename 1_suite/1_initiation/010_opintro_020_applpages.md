### Activation status

Application pages display activation status by add-on/sub module (if there are any). Statuses are:
* Inactive
* Activated in test
* Activated in production
  
And:
* Not subscribed (add-on is not included in the subscription)
* Managed by implementation partner (activation from the Onboarding Portal is currently not supported)

### Actions

Activation tasks are displayed as tiles. A task is either:
* Pending on another task to be completed first
* Available for start
* Completed 

When starting an activation task, a new pop-up window will appear taking you through activation step by step (or in a single step) with instructions for completing the task.

There are two categories:
1. Automated = will be executed in near real-time
2. Semi-automated = request made to be picked up and processed manually

Emails will be sent to contacts defined via Onboarding Portal settings once a task is completed and status will also be reflected on the task tile and on the home page.

### Information

For some applications you can also access additional information from the application pages.
