### Deployment status

Application pages display deployment status by sub module (if there are any) and environment (QA and Prod).

### Deployment tasks

Deployment tasks are displayed as tiles. A task has either of the statuses below:
* Pending on another task to be completed first
* Available for start
* Completed 

When starting a deployment task, a new pop-up window will appear taking you through deployment step by step (or in a single step) with instructions for completing the task.

There are two categories:
1. Automated = will be executed in near real-time
2. Semi-automated = request made via Jira

Emails will be sent to contacts defined via settings once a task is completed and status will also be reflected on the task tile and in the progress bar on the home page.

### Information

For some applications you can also access additional information from the product pages.
