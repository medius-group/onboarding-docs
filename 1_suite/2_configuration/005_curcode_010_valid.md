Medius sets up the most commonly used currency codes by default, but the first step in setting up the environment should be to check the list to ensure the currency codes you will be using are there. 

### If currency code is missing
If any accounting currency code used by your legal entities is missing you need to add it manually before creating the companies. This is done by following below steps.
