This section covers the application, Medius Buy settings that needs to be configured based upon your organization's structure and processes. 
We recommend this is done in cooperation with your implementation partner that can guide you through this process.

Before getting started it is recommended to study the introduction to [Procurement workflows](https://success.mediusflow.com/documentation/administration_guide/applications/procurement/workflow/) and go through all workflow steps presented in subpages. 
Based on findings and preferred workflow Medius should be configured in the areas presented below.

## Procurement application responsible settings
In Medius you assign users or roles responsible for different steps of the process. 
These settings determine what users or group of users that are responsible to perform certain tasks.

Best practice is to use roles instead of individual users to be able to share workload as well a if 
there are changes to responsibilities/teams. 

Verify standard setup or apply desired adjustments here: [Enterprise responsible settings](https://cloud.mediusflow.com/$TenantNameQA/#/Administration/Medius.Core.Entities.Company)

1. Choose what Company to apply settings to. It is recommended to apply settings at virtual level for minimal administration.
2. Go to tab "Buy".
3. Go to sub tab "Responsible".

## Business rule settings
Much of how the workflow determined is through business rule configuration. It is not required to adjust business rule settings but they should be reviewed and confirmed/adjusted to fit your organization's processes and needs. 

Here you will find a complete list of the business rules for the Medius Buy application to be verified: [Procurement application business rules](https://success.mediusflow.com/documentation/administration_guide/perspectives_and_business_rules/#procurement).
