# **Note**

>When creating Dashboards, the account you are logged on with will be the owner of those dashboards. This means that other users, even if they have access to them, will not be able to make any changes to them. They will not be able to add or remove gadgets, nor to change the settings of an existing gadget. This is a good thing, as it prevents someone from making changes without realizing that they are affecting everyone else.

>It is important to create the Dashboard in the appropriate order. In what order the dashboards are created will determine in what order the tabs ar lined up, and it can be very frustrating to have the most commonly used Dashboard being the second tab as the application always will return to the first tab. The order of the tab cannot be changed without deleting the dashboards and re-creating them in the correct order. You want to get this right from the start.

## Grant dashboards to relevant roles

Assign the relevant roles to default dashboards as follows:

   * Core Standard Application Role
3.	Invoice Search - Open invoices

Repeat steps for all dasboards and roles. 

## 4. Benchmark

>The Benchmark Dashboard contains information that not all users should have access to. Decide which users/roles that should have access. As a standard we grant permission to the Auditor role.

By default the gadgets Manual Workflow Task Metrics and Task Completion Time Per User and Role are restricted and you will need to activate them.

To access these settings go to Administration > Gadget
1. Select the gadget and go to the Access tab.
2. In Role list type in Auditor and then click Add role 
3. Click Save

Create a new Dashboard with two columns and add these gadgets:
