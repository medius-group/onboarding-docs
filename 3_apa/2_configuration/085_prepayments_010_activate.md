The Prepayment module streamlines your financial operations by allowing prepayment invoices to be processed as a new document type within Medius AP Automation. With this feature, open prepayments are automatically applied to incoming invoices that match the corresponding purchase order. 

It reduces manual interventions and mitigates risk of double payments.
