> This relates to deviations between a purchase order invoice and the connected goods receipts.

Most clients want Medius to force the user to add a comment if they reject a deviation. This is how you activate this feature.

Go to Administration --> Company --> [Virtual Company for ERP] --> Order-based--> Deviation Handling.

1.	Click the checkbox under the Comment is required on rejected deviations header labelled "Inherited from Root company". The label should change to "Defined in selected company".
2.	Set the toggle to: Yes
3.	Click the **Save**  button

You should now have a screen that look something like this:
