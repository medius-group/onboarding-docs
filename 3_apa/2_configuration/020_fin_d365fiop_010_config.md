## Dimensions

The coding dimensions in Medius should reflect the G/L and dimension setup you are using in D35FO. In Medius, the order of dimensions is determined by the number of the dimensions used.

Medius needs to be configured with what dimensions and dimension names that are relevant for your organization. 
Dimensions are configured in the [Company configuration](https://cloud.mediusflow.com/$TenantNameQA/#/Administration/Medius.Core.Entities.Company/). Then browse to the **Enterprise** tab and choose **Dimensions**.
**Note:** *Dimensions 8-11 are locked for project postings and dimension12 is locked for taxcode.*

Dimensions can be configured at virtual company level and/or in the real company codes. The dimensions that are shared between the companies in the virtual group is recommended to be configured at virtual level. 

Please consider that names of the dimensions are not impacted by user language settings. So, if you'd like to use different dimension names for different companies Dimension configuration should not be done at virtual level.

In addition to the above dimensions it is suggested to enable a free text dimension for the purpose of approvers to enter an descriptive text to the G/L entry that will also be posted to the G/L entry in D365FO.

In a newly created tenant the dimension configuration looks like this:

1. Click the **Inherited from Root company** checkbox, changing it to **Defined in selected company** for all rows in the table.
2. Set the toggles in the **Active** column for the Dimensions you want to use to **Yes**.
3. Enter the appropriate dimension name for the dimensions that should be used in the *Name* column. This name will be displayed in the tooltips. These tooltips appear when one of the coding fields is active. 
4. Enter a short version of the label in the **Short name** column. This name will be displayed in the coding field itself.
5. Enable *Free text dimension 1* with appropriate name to allow for G/L text entry. Set the maximum length to **60** since this is maximum number of characters acccepted by D365FO. 
6. Click **Save**.
