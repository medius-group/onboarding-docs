The following information needs to be sent to the client (or their service provider):
1. GlobalId for the company/companies.
2. Company name(s) connected to the above ids (so the client knows which company invoices are going to be sent to)
3. Tenant
4. Client’s ID
5. Client’s Secret

**IMPORTANT**

For security reasons: Do not send ID and Secret in the same message and with the same communication type. You can for example send one part (the Secret) via email and the other (the ID) via sms.
