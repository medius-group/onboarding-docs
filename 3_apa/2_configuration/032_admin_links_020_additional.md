Like with the favorite links these settings around the links at the bottom of the admin page are specific to the client but below are some suggestions. Looking over these settings can prevent confusion and user errors moving forward.

Make sure that these entries are active (some will already be active by default):
* Business Log Reports
    * Here we can pull reports on changes to settings related to users and their access/privileges in the system
    * Inactive by default
    * Access typically given to: Admin role and Auditor role
* Studio
    * Here you are going to be adding API based Business Rules as needed

If your organization will be relying on local authentication, activate:
* Password Management

As an example, below are instructions for how to activate the Business Log Reports and assign them to the Admin and Auditor roles.

Go to Administration --> Administration Additional link

1.	Select the entry that says "Business Logs Reports" in the Display column
2.	In the General tab, set the "Active" toggle to: Yes
3.	In the Role tab, check the check boxes next to Admin Role and Auditor role
4.	Click the **Save** button
