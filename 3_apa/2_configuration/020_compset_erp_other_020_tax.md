Medius allows for a range of Tax related settings. This is highly dependant on ERP and regional practises. The standard configuration in AP Automation is to utilize tax indicator in line level, so these needs to be turned off.

1. Go to: **Administration > Company > [Virtual Company for ERP] > Enterprise > Tax**.
2. Find the **Tax handling type** label.
3. Click the **Inherited from Root company**  checkbox, changing it to **Defined in selected company**.
4. Select **Tax on head level, no tax codes** in the drop down.
5. Click **Save**.
