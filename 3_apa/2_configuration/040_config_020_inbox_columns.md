Review and adjust the default settings for what columns that should be available in the inbox. Exactly what columns to enable can vary from client to client, but this is a good place to start.

Go to Administration --> Folder --> [My tasks] --> Editor for column configuration.

Filter the Type column on "OrderBasedInvoice"  and make sure the following check boxes are marked, and no other:

1. Company (sometimes it makes sense to replace this column with the Company Id column)
2. Invoice no
3. Order ID
4. Amount
5. Currency (only leave this one checked if invoices in multiple currencies are processed)
6. Supplier
7. Due date
8. Invoice date

Then click the Save button.
