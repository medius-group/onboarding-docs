Information about Roles and how they can be modified can be found here:

We normally want to allow members of the Orderbased Analyzer and Orderbased AP roles to reroute deviations to other users.

See below regarding the rerouting of deviations.

Go to Administration --> Role --> [Orderbased AP]  --> Access Keys

1.	Check the checkbox next to Medius.Enterprise.AuthorizationKeys.Deviations.RedistributeDeviations
2.	Then click the **Save** button.

Repeat for Administration --> Role --> [Orderbased Analyzer]  --> Access Keys

You should have a screen that looks something like this:
